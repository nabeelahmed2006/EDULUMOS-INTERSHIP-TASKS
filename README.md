Face Detection System using OpenCV:


This project is a real-time Face Detection System built using Python and the OpenCV library. It utilizes the Haar Cascade algorithm to identify human faces through a live webcam feed or static images. This project serves as a foundational implementation of Computer Vision, with the potential to be extended into facial recognition, crowd counting, or automated attendance systems.
